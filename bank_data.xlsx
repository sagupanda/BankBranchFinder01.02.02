This file should contain the Excel data with columns: Bank Name, City, Branch, IFSC, MICR, Address, State. Since I cannot create actual Excel files, this is a placeholder. In a real implementation, you would place your actual Excel file here with the bank data.

The application will handle the case where this file doesn't exist by creating an empty DataFrame and showing appropriate error messages.
